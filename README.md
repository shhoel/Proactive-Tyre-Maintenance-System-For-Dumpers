ðŸš› PROACTIVE TYRE MAINTENANCE SYSTEM FOR DUMPERS
ðŸ”§ An IoT-Powered Real-Time Monitoring and Predictive Analytics Platform
ðŸ“– Description
Proactive Tyre Maintenance System for Dumpers is a smart, IoT-enabled solution designed to enhance tyre performance and safety in mining and heavy-duty industrial environments. This system continuously monitors critical tyre and vehicle parameters using real-time sensor data and predicts tyre health using advanced machine learning models. It calculates the TKPH (Tonne Kilometres Per Hour) to ensure tyres operate within safe thermal limits and helps prevent premature tyre failures.

The project uses an ESP32 microcontroller to collect sensor data including temperature, pressure, vibration, tilt, speed, and location. This data is sent to a Java Spring Boot backend for processing, storage in a MySQL database, and analysis using trained machine learning models. Users can access a responsive web dashboard to visualize live sensor data, receive alerts, and review ML-based predictions.
